# Generating-Music-with-LSTM-Networks

Group project with Gitika Meher, Nasha Meoli, Ambareesh S J and Farheen Ahluwalia.

The training can be done by running the RNN.py file. The network gives good results after training about 1000 epochs. The testing code is also part of the .py file. The best model and generated results are saved during the training in the same place directory where the code runs.

Results and implementation details can be found in the project report.
